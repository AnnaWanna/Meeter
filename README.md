An app helping to choose the best place for you and your friends to meet. 

### Introduction

"Meeter" is a recommending system suggesting a group of friends which place to choose for their meeting. 

The proposed local will be chosen based on the preferences of each friend, according to types of their favourite food, drinks and the general type of desired place, like restaurant, bar or café. 

Another factor will be the distance of each user to the place, rating and the degree of congestion. The data will be gathered from Google API as well as from the users themselves.
