## App documentation
![Meeter](http://pages.mini.pw.edu.pl/~gorzynskik/HTMLPostGIS/Meeter/wwwroot/meeter.svg)

An app helping to choose the best place for you and your friends to meet. 

### Introduction

*Meeter* is a recommending system suggesting a group of friends which place to choose for their meeting. 

The proposed local will be chosen based on the preferences of each friend, according to types of their favourite food, drinks and the general type of desired place, like restaurant, bar or caf√©. 

Another factor will be the distance of each user to the place, rating and the degree of congestion. The data will be gathered from Google API as well as from the users themselves. 

![Routes](http://pages.mini.pw.edu.pl/~gorzynskik/HTMLPostGIS/Meeter/routes-screen.png)
Routes of each friend (A) to the selected place (B).

### Use-cases

List of roles:
* User - everyone who is logged-in 
* Group member - user who has joined a specific group
* Group member (virtual) - a person who participates in the meeting but does not have their Meeter account
* Group leader - user who has created a specified group
* Administrator - user with special permissions, sees all of the created groups and has the access to the users' data

## Prerequisites

* Linux / Windows PC
  * For Mac OS, app works only with in-memory database. To build, replace in *Startup.cs*:

        services.AddDbContext<NormalDataContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(connection));
        
    with:

        services.AddDbContext<NormalDataContext>(opts => opts.UseInMemoryDatabase("MeeterDatabase"));
  

* Visual Studio 2017/2019 with .NET Core 2.1
* SQL Server

## User guide
Before starting the program, you can create SQL database; otherwise you have to create InMemoryDatabase.
Using SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio), connect to local database:
            
    (LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB

![Connect to Server](http://pages.mini.pw.edu.pl/~gorzynskik/HTMLPostGIS/Meeter/connect-to-server.png)

Write command in Package Menager Console:

    Update-database

Refresh *(LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB* by right click on it and choose *Refresh*.

Check if in folder Databases exists: *MeeterAplicationDB* with tables:
![Tables](http://pages.mini.pw.edu.pl/~gorzynskik/HTMLPostGIS/Meeter/tables.png)

If operation succeeded, you can start the application. 

### Checking Authorization
If you would like to check the authorization mode, go to *Startup.cs* and set e-mail to yours in *CreateUserRoles* method.

    private async Task CreateUserRoles(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        ...
        User user = await UserManager.FindByEmailAsync("[YOUR E-MAIL]");
        ...
    }

Then start the application login using this e-mail, stop debugging. Check in database if in table *AspNetUserRoles* is your id (you can see your id in *AspNetUsers* table) and Role Admin id (you can check it in *AspNetRoles* table). At the end start the application one more time and login using admin email.
Check Admin sites:
http://localhost:5000/api/Group/Index
http://localhost:5000/api/Event/Index

## Technologies used

* Client-side
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * AJAX
  * Google Maps API

* Server-side
  * ASP .NET Core 2.1
  * Microsoft SQL Server

## Conclusions

* Due to the .NET's just-in-time compilation, some errors do not prevent launching the application. It causes the app to start faster, but also to be harder to debug. 
* Passing data between the backend and frontend by sending HTTP requests manually and fetching them is tedious. When app becomes larger, rewriting code to Razor and using Views makes it much cleaner and simpler. 
* Models work just like database tables, that's why they should be coded not like the traditional classes nested one in another, but like the related tables, binded by marking the members as virtual. Unfortunately, we are still facing problems trying to get all the data via the relations and avoiding searching it manually by the id. 
* Authentication and authorization are a real tough nut to crack when doing it for the first time. Range of different methods makes it hard to look for advice in online tutorials. 
* The salary of full-stack developer is definitely deserved! ü§ë

## Developer guide

### Database

Creating the database with users inheriting from IdentityUser. 


    public class NormalDataContext : IdentityDbContext<User, IdentityRole, string>
    

Loading static data from json file automatically on database update.

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
        {
            base.OnModelCreating(builder);
            var myJsonString = File.ReadAllText("preferences.json");
            List<Type> ptypes = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<Type>>(myJsonString);
            builder.Entity<Type>().HasData(ptypes.ToArray());
            // Customize the ASP.NET Core Identity model and override the defaults if needed. 

            //builder.Entity<IdentityUserRole<Guid>>().HasKey(p => new { p.UserId, p.RoleId });
        }

Hiding the secret information in *appsettings.Secret.json* file (ignored by git). 

    {
      "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Debug",
          "System": "Information",
          "Microsoft": "Information"
        }
      }, 
      "AdminEmail": "YOUR_EMAIL",
      "GoogleKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY"
    }
